# spotify-classifier

This is a project I did as a part of a unit called Software Technology 1 at the University of Canberra.
I chose the dataset from Kaggle and did Exploratory Data Analysis
and Predictive Data Analysis on it. 

Here's the link to the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/salvatorerastelli/spotify-and-youtube

The aim of the EDA is to get a deeper insight into the 
the attributes of a song on spotify. Questions I'm trying to answer are:
  What kind of songs do people like to listen to? 
  Which attributes do the most popular songs on spotify have?
  
As for the PDA, the algorithm was trained to predict the Album type (i.e. Single, Album, Compilation) 
of a song based on its attributes.
